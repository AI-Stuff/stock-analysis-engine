Stock Analysis Engine
=====================

Analyze information about publicly traded companies from `Yahoo <https://finance.yahoo.com/>`__, `IEX Real-Time Price <https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/>`__ and `FinViz <https://finviz.com>`__ (datafeeds supported: news, screeners, quotes, dividends, daily, intraday, statistics, financials, earnings, options, and more). Once collected the data is archived in s3 (using `minio <https://minio.io>`__) and automatically cached in redis. Deploys with `Kubernetes <https://github.com/AlgoTraders/stock-analysis-engine#running-on-kubernetes>`__ or docker compose with `support for publishing alerts to Slack <https://github.com/AlgoTraders/stock-analysis-engine/blob/master/compose/docker/notebooks/Stock-Analysis-Intro-Publishing-to-Slack.ipynb>`__.

The engine provides an automated, horizontally scalable stock data collection and archive pipeline with a simple extraction interface above a redis datastore.

Fetch
-----

With redis and minio running (``./compose/start.sh``), you can fetch, cache, archive and return all of the newest datasets for tickers:

.. code-block:: python

    from analysis_engine.fetch import fetch
    d = fetch(ticker='NFLX')
    for k in d['NFLX']:
        print('dataset key: {}\nvalue {}\n'.format(k, d['NFLX'][k]))

Extract
-------

Once collected and cached, you can extract datasets:

.. code-block:: python

    from analysis_engine.extract import extract
    d = extract(ticker='NFLX')
    for k in d['NFLX']:
        print('dataset key: {}\nvalue {}\n'.format(k, d['NFLX'][k]))

Please refer to the `Stock Analysis Intro Extracting Datasets Jupyter Notebook <https://github.com/AlgoTraders/stock-analysis-engine/blob/master/compose/docker/notebooks/Stock-Analysis-Intro-Extracting-Datasets.ipynb>`__ for the latest usage examples.
