Stock Analysis Engine
=====================

Analyze information about publicly traded companies from `Yahoo <https://finance.yahoo.com/>`__ and `IEX Real-Time Price <https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/>`__ (supported data includes: news, quotes, dividends, daily, intraday, statistics, financials, earnings, options, and more). Once collected the data is archived in s3 (using `minio <https://minio.io>`__) and automatically cached in redis. Deploys with `Kubernetes <https://github.com/AlgoTraders/stock-analysis-engine#running-on-kubernetes>`__ or docker compose.

The engine provides an automated, horizontally scalable stock data collection and archive pipeline with a simple extraction interface above a redis datastore.

Once collected and cached, you can quickly extract datasets with:

.. code-block:: python

    from analysis_engine.api_requests import get_ds_dict
    from analysis_engine.yahoo.extract_df_from_redis import extract_option_calls_dataset
    dataset_req = get_ds_dict(ticker='NFLX', label='nflx-test')
    extract_status, netflix_call_options_df = extract_option_calls_dataset(dataset_req)
    print(netflix_call_options_df)

Please refer to the `Stock Analysis Intro Extracting Datasets Jupyter Notebook <https://github.com/AlgoTraders/stock-analysis-engine/blob/master/compose/docker/notebooks/Stock-Analysis-Intro-Extracting-Datasets.ipynb>`__ for the latest usage examples.
